# Dots
I use [GNU Stow](http://brandon.invergo.net/news/2012-05-26-using-gnu-stow-to-manage-your-dotfiles.html) to place dotfiles where needed. For example, to have the i3wm related dotfiles, do
```bash
stow i3wm
```
Alternatively, script ``setup.sh`` installs programs and utilities I usually want. 
Script ``rice.sh`` installs themes and icons plus the i3wm-related packages I currently use (see i3wm config).
